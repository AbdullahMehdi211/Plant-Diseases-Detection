# Plant-Diseases-Detection
This project focuses on detecting plant diseases using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on image datasets of plants with various diseases and healthy plants to classify and diagnose plant health conditions.

Features

Uses deep learning to identify plant diseases.

Implements image preprocessing techniques.

Utilizes PyTorch for model training and inference.

Provides visualization of results using Seaborn and Matplotlib.


Installation

To run this project, install the required dependencies using the following command:

pip install numpy torch torchvision seaborn colorama


Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/AbdullahMehdi211/plant-disease-detection.git
